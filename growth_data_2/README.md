Each of the .xlsx files uploaded in the growth_data_2 folder corresponds to the green values measured in the growth profiler in a 96-well plate for 48hours. The second cultivation was started with 5 uL taken from the first cultivation after 48h and inoculated in the 96-well plate in exactly the same layout as the first cultivation. The summary of the 96-well plate can be found in the plate_layout folder named plate_legend.xlsx. A total of 24 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were tested under the same conditions. Each of the files correspond to one strain.
